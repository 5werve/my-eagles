Description:

Develop a new mobile application for the students at your school. Your app should include a scheduling feature allowing students to input their schedule, information about extracurricular activities, a lunch menu, the ability to email teachers and staff, and a calendar that is updated with school information. The user can also share their schedule using their device's default share menu.

Bugs: none so far
